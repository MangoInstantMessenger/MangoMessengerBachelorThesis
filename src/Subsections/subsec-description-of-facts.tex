% Current state of the market, other competing applications on the market, who is end user?
% Is the market saturated?
% What are competing apps different?
% What are needs for this application from end-user and provider of an app?
%Research [\cite{mannan2005secure}] provides analysis on the worms and other issues on IMS\@.
%Resource [\cite{mannan2004secure}] provides comprehensive survey on security aspects of IMS\@.
Analyzing the topic of the end user needs, we confirm that these are quite classic, such as
quick, comfortable and secure information exchange, including not only text message but as well
images, files, hyper-refs.
The same needs hold for commercial approach, however with slightly stronger security requirements.
In order to reach desirable quality level of the application, it is worth to familiarize with an
experience of the products available on market such that address the same problematic.
Fon instance, currently the applications like \textit{Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp}
are on the competitive level and fit for commercial
and non-commercial usages.
For example, telegram bots may be successfully used in business [\cite{ilchenko2017using}].
