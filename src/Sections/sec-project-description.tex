Nowadays, instant messaging systems achieve a great success and became the main mean of communication
between people via an internet.
Thanks to the simplicity and quickness of the message exchanging more and more people over the world start to use
instant messengers on daily basis.
However, such a great attention forces us to discuss another aspect of these systems, an aspect of the

The main aim of this thesis is to design and implement an instant messaging system
that copes with the required functionalities and satisfies the defined security requirements.
