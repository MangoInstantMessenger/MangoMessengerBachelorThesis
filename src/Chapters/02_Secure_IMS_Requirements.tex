\chapter{Instant messaging system requirements}\label{ch:instant-messaging-system-requirements}

In previous sections we have briefly discussed Instant Messaging System, mainly from security and user privacy aspects.
Prior to software module implementation, it is essentially important to define the functionality module will obtain.
Not to overcomplicate this section, we discuss the secure IMS requirements from customer's prospective.

There are different types of product requirements: business, functional, and non-functional.
Business requirements typically answer how the product will address the needs of your company and its users.
They also reveal the business model of the app and what problems it can solve.
Functional requirements are about functionalities that will be implemented in the app.
Non-functional requirements describe how these functionalities will be implemented.

In this article, we only focus on functional requirements.
In simple words, functional requirements are not ideas of how to solve problems or which technologies to use but rather
are descriptions of software functionality.
Mostly common and simple way to define software product's functional requirements is User Stories.
User stories should be understandable both to developers and to you as the client, and should be written in simple words.
The most popular way of writing a user story is with the following formula:

\begin{center}
    "As a <user type>, I want <goal> so that <reason>."
\end{center}


\section{Functional requirements}\label{sec:functional-requirements}
To compete with successful and commonly used instant messaging platforms, your service has to offer great functionality.

    \item Registration, Authorization, Authentication
    \item Sending messages and media to individuals
    \item Manage contacts
    \item Creating groups

Note that Authentication means confirming your own identity, whereas authorization means being allowed access to the system.
