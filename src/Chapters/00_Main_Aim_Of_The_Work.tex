Mobile application to be implemented as Android version.
Main task of current thesis could be split by sub-tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze existing IMS security and user privacy vulnerabilities.
    \item Based on previous research, propose the functional, non-functional requirements for IMS.
    \item Propose an architecture for IMS.
    \item Implement an instant messaging system architecture that copes with the required functionalities and
    satisfies the defined security requirements.
\end{itemize}
