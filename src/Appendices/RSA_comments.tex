\subsection{One way functions}\label{subsec:one-way-functions}
One way function -- is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but
hard to invert given the image of a random input.
For instance, the function
\begin{equation*}
    f(m) = m^e \bmod N \equiv C
\end{equation*}
where $e, N$ are public constants is one-awy function,
because it is easy to compute $C$ given $m$, however it is hard to compute $m$ given $C$.

\subsection{Euler's totient theorem}\label{subsec:euler-function}
Given a number $N$ and its prime factorization $p_1^{e_1}\cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, then Euler's totient function
$\phi(N)$ is defined as

\[
    \phi(N) = (p_1^{e_1} - p_1^{e_1 - 1}) \cdot (p_2^{e_2} - p_2^{e_2 - 1}) \cdots (p_k^{e_k} - p_k^{e_k - 1})
\]

In particular, for positive number $M$ such that its factorization is $p1 \cdot p2$, the $\phi(M)$ is

\[
    \phi(M) = (p_1 -1) \cdot (p_2 - 1)
\]

Euler's theorem relates the modular division and exponent as follows, given number $m$, then
\[
    m^{\phi(N)} = 1 \bmod N
\]
It means that reminder of division $m^{\phi(N)}$ by $N$ is always 1.
By the equality $1^K = 1$
\[
    M^{K \cdot \phi(N)} = 1 \bmod N
\]
If we multiply both parts by $M$, we get
\[
    M \cdot M^{K \cdot \phi(N)} = M^{K \cdot \phi(N) + 1} = M \bmod N
\]
