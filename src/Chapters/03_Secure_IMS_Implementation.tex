\section{Application architecture and UML modeling}\label{sec:application-architecture-and-uml-modeling}

\subsection{Motivation}\label{subsec:motivation}
As a programmers, I believe all we have faced the cases of crucial over-engineering during the implementation of some software product.
For the programmer, it is a vital point to follow two separated, but closely related software development principles, such that
KISS [INSERTREF], and YAGNI [INSERTREF].
As the main topic of our thesis is the security and privacy aspects of Instant Messaging Systems, we consider following
previously discussed principles KISS and YAGNI and use a well-known Monolithic architecture [INSERTREF].
One would suggest to use nowadays popular Microservice Architecture, thinking about scalability [INSERTREF],
an ability of the system to handle large numbers of users distributed over geographically large areas without notably affecting
the overall performance of the system.
However, the effect of Microservices is felt only for quite large and complex systems, not the case of Instant Messaging System
we implement in chapter [number].
It is worthless to divide the functional requirements, discussed in section [number] into microservices and that's central point
in motivation to use Monolithic Architecture.
Following plot demonstrates the relation between complexity of system and architecture.

\subsection{Application layers}\label{subsec:application-layers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer.} Responsible for external communication, e.g.\ API gateway, front-end application etc.
    \item \textbf{Application Logic.} Responsible for interaction with user, for instance email sender, realtime notification service etc.
    \item \textbf{Business Logic.} Keeps application business logics, request handlers etc.
    \item \textbf{Data Access Layer.} Interface of interaction with database.
    \item \textbf{Database.} Simply, database itself.\ For instance, Relational, NoSQL, Cache database etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monolith Architecture: Cons and Props}\label{subsec:monolith-architecture:-cons-and-props}

A monolith is built as a large system with a single code base and deployed as a single unit, usually behind a load balancer.
It typically consists of four major components: a user interface, business logic, a data interface and a database.
Monoliths offer several advantages, particularly when it comes to operational overhead requirements.
Here are some of those basic benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simplicity.} Monolithic architectures are simple to build, test and deploy.
    These apps can scale horizontally, in one direction, by running several copies of the application behind a load balancer.
    Cross-cutting concerns: With a single codebase, monolithic apps can easily handle cross-cutting concerns, such as logging,
    configuration management and performance monitoring.
    Another advantage associated with the simplicity of monolithic apps is easier deployment.
    When it comes to monolithic applications, you do not have to handle many deployments – just one file or directory.
    \item \textbf{Performance.} Components in a monolith typically share memory which is faster than service-to-service communications using
    IPC [INSERTREF] or other mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{Easier debugging and testing.}
    In contrast to the microservices architecture, monolithic applications are much easier to debug and test.
    Since a monolithic app is a single indivisible unit, you can run end-to-end testing much faster.
    \item \textbf{Easier development.} As long as the monolithic approach is a standard way of building applications,
    any engineering team has the right knowledge and capabilities to develop a monolithic application.
\end{itemize}
But one major drawback of monolithic architectures is tight coupling.
Over time, monolithic components become tightly coupled and entangled.
This coupling effects management, scalability and continuous deployment.
Other cons that stem from tight coupling include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Understanding.} When a monolithic application scales up, it becomes too complicated to understand.
    Also, a complex system of code within one application is hard to manage.
    \item \textbf{Reliability.} An error in any of the modules in the application can bring the entire application down.
    \item \textbf{Updates.} Due to a single large codebase and tight coupling, the entire application would have to deploy
    for each update.
    \item \textbf{Technology stack.} A monolithic application must use the same technology stack throughout.
    Changes to the technology stack are expensive, both in terms of the time and cost involved.
    \item \textbf{Scalability.} You cannot scale components independently, only the whole application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decoupling Monolith using CQRS}\label{subsec:decoupling-monolith-using-cqrs}
As it stated in previous section, monolithic architecture provides a quite strong coupling between application
components.
Moreover, as monolith grow horizontally, its services layer grows as well.
This process leads to very huge code base which is very difficult to support and extend.
We attach the following
\href{https://github.com/smartstore/SmartStoreNET/blob/4.x/src/Presentation/SmartStore.Web/Controllers/CatalogHelper.cs}
{link}
as an example of such approach.
To avoid the natural results of monolithic architecture, that are huge classes for thousands lines, we have to dive into design patterns.
Precisely, the mediator pattern would help to decouple the service layer from presentation layer.
Mediator -- is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.
In other words, mediator allows the communication between two entities, such that entities doesn't know each other.
The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you want to make
independent of each other.
Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to
appropriate components.
As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.

In context of .NET platform there are multiple implementation of the Mediator, the most widely known and used is the
\href{https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR}{MediatR}, which we use in our project.

Another, yet popular approach is the CQRS, which stands for Command-Query Responsibility Segregation.
In brief, it stands that read (query) and write (command) requests should be segregated by their responsibilities.
The CQRS approach in couple with Mediator greatly helps to solve the coupling problem of the monolith architecture.
So what is CQRS precisely?
According to Martin Fowler [INSERTREF],
It's a pattern that first described by Greg Young [INSERTREF].
At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information.
For some situations, this separation can be valuable, but beware that for most systems CQRS adds risky complexity.
The mainstream approach people use for interacting with an information system is to treat it as a CRUD datastore.
By this meant that we have mental model of some record structure where we can create new records, read records,
update existing records, and delete records when we're done with them.
In the simplest case, our interactions are all about storing and retrieving these records.
As our needs become more sophisticated we steadily move away from that model.
We may want to look at the information in a different way to the record store, perhaps collapsing multiple records into one,
or forming virtual records by combining information for different places.
On the update side we may find validation rules that only allow certain combinations of data to be stored, or may even infer
data to be stored that's different from that we provide.
For instance, the idea of command-query segregation is displayed at the following image

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Pictures/cqrs.pdf}
    \caption{CQRS Conceptual diagram. Source: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html}\label{fig:figure}
\end{figure}

Despite these benefits, you should be very cautious about using CQRS.
Many information systems fit well with the notion of an information base that is updated in the same way that it's read,
adding CQRS to such a system can add significant complexity.
I've certainly seen cases where it's made a significant drag on productivity, adding an unwarranted amount of risk to the
project, even in the hands of a capable team.
So while CQRS is a pattern that's good to have in the toolbox, beware that it is difficult to use well and you can easily
chop off important bits if you mishandle it.

As a short conclusion, we may state that CQRS and Mediator pattern will not entirely solve the coupling problems the monolith,
however will make project much more simplistic and intuitively understood.
It is worth to keep is simple,
even relatively simple project may grow to the sizes of universe without proper architectural solutions.

\section{Security aspects of HTTPS protocol}\label{sec:security-aspects-of-https-protocol}
General discussion on HTTP here.

\subsection{Diffie-Hellman Protocol}\label{subsec:diffie-hellman-protocol}

Diffie–Hellman key exchange [INSERTREF] is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel
and was one of the first public-key protocols
as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman.
DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.

Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private
key and a corresponding public key.

Traditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical means,
such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier.
The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of
each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.

Although Diffie–Hellman key agreement itself is a non-authenticated key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a
variety of authenticated protocols,
and is used to provide forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's ephemeral modes
(referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).

\textbf{Description}:

Diffie–Hellman key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication
for exchanging data over a public network.
An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Pictures/Diffie-Hellman.pdf}
    \caption{Illustration of the concept behind Diffie–Hellman key exchange}\label{fig:figure4}
\end{figure}

The process begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob, publicly agree on an arbitrary starting color that does
not need to be kept secret (but should be different every time).
In this example, the color is yellow.
Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves – in this case, red and blue-green.
The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually
shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors.
Finally, each of them mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color.
The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to the partner's final color mixture.

If a third party listened to the exchange, it would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors
(orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be difficult for this party to determine the final secret color (yellow-brown).
Bringing the analogy back to a real-life exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is
computationally expensive.
It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern supercomputers.

\textbf{Cryptographic explanation}:
\newline
The simplest and the original implementation of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo p,
where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p.
These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to p–1.
Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in \textcolor{blue}{blue}, and secret values in \textcolor{red}{red}.
\newline
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alice and Bob publicly agree to use a modulus \textcolor{blue}{p = 23} and base \textcolor{blue}{g = 5} (which is a primitive root modulo 23).

    \item Alice chooses a secret integer $\textcolor{red}{a} = 4$, then sends Bob $\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{a}} \, mod  \, \textcolor{blue}{p}$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{blue}{5}^{\textcolor{red}{4}} \, mod  \, \textcolor{blue}{23} = \textcolor{blue}{4}$
    \end{itemize}

    \item Bob chooses a secret integer $\textcolor{red}{b} = 3$, then sends Alice $\textcolor{blue}{B} = \textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{b}} \, mod  \, \textcolor{blue}{p}$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\textcolor{blue}{B} = \textcolor{blue}{5}^{\textcolor{red}{3}} \, mod  \, \textcolor{blue}{23} = \textcolor{blue}{10}$
    \end{itemize}

    \item Alice computes $\textcolor{red}{s} = \textcolor{blue}{B}^{\textcolor{red}{a}} \, mod \, p$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\textcolor{red}{s} = \textcolor{blue}{10}^{\textcolor{red}{4}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{23} = \textcolor{red}{18}$
    \end{itemize}

    \item Bob computes $\textcolor{red}{s} = \textcolor{blue}{A}^{\textcolor{red}{b}} \, mod \, p$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\textcolor{red}{s} = \textcolor{blue}{4}^{\textcolor{red}{3}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{23} = \textcolor{red}{18}$
    \end{itemize}

    \item Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 18).
\end{enumerate}

Both Alice and Bob have arrived at the same values because under mod p:
\newline
\newline
$\textcolor{blue}{A}^{\textcolor{red}{b}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p} = \textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{ab}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p} = \textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{ba}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p} = \textcolor{blue}{B}^{\textcolor{red}{a}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p}$
\newline
More specifically:
\newline
\newline
$(\textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{a}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p})^{\textcolor{red}{b}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p} = (\textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{b}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p})^{\textcolor{red}{a}}$
\newline

Only a and b are kept secret.
All the other values – p, g, ga mod p, and gb mod p – are sent in the clear.
The strength of the scheme comes from the fact that gab mod p = gba mod p take extremely long times to compute by any
known algorithm just from the knowledge of p, g, ga mod p, and gb mod p.
Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending
messages across the same open communications channel.

Of course, much larger values of a, b, and p would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible
results of n mod 23.
However, if p is a prime of at least 600 digits, then even the fastest modern computers using the fastest known algorithm
cannot find a given only g, p and ga mod p.
Such a problem is called the discrete logarithm problem [INSERTREF].
The computation of ga mod p is known as modular exponentiation and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.
Note that g need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).
\newline
\textbf{Secrecy Chart}:
\newline
The chart below depicts who knows what, again with non-secret values in \textcolor{blue}{blue}, and secret values in \textcolor{red}{red}.
Here Eve is an eavesdropper – she watches what is sent between Alice and Bob, but she does not alter the contents of their communications.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{g} = public (prime) base, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. $\textcolor{blue}{g = 5}$
    \item \textcolor{blue}{p} = public (prime) modulus, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. $\textcolor{blue}{p = 23}$
    \item \textcolor{red}{a} = Alice's private key, known only to Alice. $\textcolor{red}{a = 6}$
    \item \textcolor{red}{b} = Bob's private key known only to Bob. $\textcolor{red}{b = 15}$
    \item \textcolor{blue}{A} = Alice's public key, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. $\textcolor{blue}{A = g}^{\textcolor{red}{a}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p = 8}$
    \item \textcolor{blue}{B} = Bob's public key, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. $\textcolor{blue}{B = g}^{\textcolor{red}{a}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p = 8}$
\end{itemize}

Now \textcolor{red}{s} is the shared secret key and it is known to both Alice and Bob, but not to Eve.
Note that it is not helpful for Eve to compute \textcolor{blue}{AB}, which equals
$\textcolor{blue}{g}^{\textcolor{red}{a} + \textcolor{red}{b}} \, mod \, \textcolor{blue}{p}$.

Note: It should be difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key or for Bob to solve for Alice's private key.
If it is not difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key (or vice versa), Eve may simply substitute her own
private / public key pair, plug Bob's public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for
Bob's private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key.
Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob's private key).
