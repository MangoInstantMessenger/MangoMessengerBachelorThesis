Mostly common and simple way to define software product's functional requirements are User Stories.
User stories [\cite{cohn2004user}] should be understandable both to developers and to you as the client, and should be written in simple words.
The most popular way of writing a user story is with the following formula:

\begin{center}
    \begin{spverbatim}
        "As a <user type>, I want <goal> so that <reason>."
    \end{spverbatim}
\end{center}

Now, let's group the main features of the application as follows

\begin{itemize}
    \item Registration
    \item Authentication
    \item Managing contacts
    \item Sending messages and media to individuals
    \item Creating and managing groups
    \item Sending messages and media to groups
    \item Viewing messages history
    \item Managing profile settings
\end{itemize}

In order not to overfill the document with the entire list of requirements, system's functional and non-functional
requirements moved to the annex A.
