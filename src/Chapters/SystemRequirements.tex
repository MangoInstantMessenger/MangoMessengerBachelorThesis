\section{System Requirements}\label{sec:system-requirements}

In previous sections we have briefly discussed Instant Messaging System, mainly from security and user privacy aspects.
Prior to software module implementation, it is essentially important to define the functionality module will obtain.
In this section we discuss functional and non-functional requirements of secure instant messaging system from customer's prospective.

Generally, there are three forms of software product requirements: business, functional, and non-functional.
Business requirements [\cite{dilworth2007creation}] typically answer how the product will address the needs of your company and its users.
They also reveal the business model of the app and what problems it can solve.
Functional requirements [\cite{malan2001functional}] are about functionalities that will be implemented in the application.
Non-functional requirements [\cite{chung2012non}] describe how these functionalities will be implemented.
