As for student, Azure offers a lot of 100USD limited "free" opportunities,
provided that we won't pay in the future.
We require only a few things: Ubuntu based virtual machine, database, static IP address.
Azure provides such discounts for the
\begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual machine \texttt{Standard B1s (1 vcpu, 1 GiB memory)}
    \item Database \texttt{Burstable, B1ms, 1 vCores, 2 GiB RAM, 32 GiB storage}
\end{itemize}
And that's enough for our purposes.
Approximate cost per month for \texttt{Standard B1s (1 vcpu, 1 GiB memory)} is 8,25 USD/month as for December 2021.
Let's create \texttt{Standard B1s (1 vcpu, 1 GiB memory)} virtual machine with the following parameters
\begin{itemize}
    \item VM name: MangoMessengerWSBProject-Backend
    \item Region: (Europe) North Europe
    \item Image: Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04 - Gen2
    \item Authentication type: SSH public key, paste key to the field
    \item Public inbound ports: 80, 443, 22
    \item OS disk type: Standard SSD
    \item IP Address: SKU -- Basic, Assignment -- Static
    \item Azure Security Center, Enable basic plan for free: disabled
    \item Monitoring, Boots diagnostics: disabled
\end{itemize}
